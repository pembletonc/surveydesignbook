# Preface {-}

Survey research in program evaluation is an efficient way to collect data from a wide range of participants, and is a field which has been used extensively in evaluation for decades. Surveys, understood to be "fundamentally a matter of asking a sample of people from a population a set of questions and using the answers to describe that population" @fowler2014, are fundamentally important to program evaluation. I hope that this book can act as something of a guide for non-statistician evaluators such as myself in how to develop effective surveys. There is an absolute abundance of research on this topic, which I draw from and cite frequently. If ever in doubt of something in this guide - check or ask for the source, I'm more than glad to correct, discuss, and share resources. I hope you enjoy the book and find it a useful reference in your work.
