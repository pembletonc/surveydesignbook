## What is considered a survey in this book? {#surveydef}

In their 6-part series written between 2001 and 2003, Shari Pfleeger and Barbara Kitchenham make the clear distinction that a survey is more than the instrument itself, it is "a comprehensive system for collecting information to describe, compare or explain knowledge, attitudes and behaviour" @pfl1. It is a system which has 10 clearly defined activities:  

1. Setting specific, measurable objectives
2. Planning and scheduling the survey
3. Ensuring that appropriate resources are available
4. Designing the survey
5. Preparing the data collection instrument
6. Validating the instrument
7. Selecting participants
8. Administering and scoring the instrument
9. Analyzing the data
10. Reporting the results.


## Prerequisite tools used and skills required

To make the most of this book, it's recommended that you have a working knowledge of the R programming language, and have some experience with digital surveying instruments such as SurveyMonkey or Limesurvey. That being said, there is much to be gained from the book even if you don't use any of these tools in your work.
